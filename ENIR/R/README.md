Preface 
===========
This is a research code and there is not guarantee on using the code.
This code includes an R package "enir" that implements our ENIR calibration method in our ICDM 2016 paper.
To run the code you should first install the neariso R package referenced inside our icdm paper. 
For the sake of completeness, a version of neariso R package that is used in our experiments is 
also provided in this repository (neariso_1.0.tar.gz). You should then install the enir package which is also included in this
repository (enir_1.0.tar.gz).



Two main methods:
===========
+ enir::build(yTrain, zTrain);

Input:

Output:




+ enir::predict(enirModel, yTest);

Input: 

enirModel: a ENIR calibration model generated using the "enir::build()" method

yTest: vector of uncalibratd classification scores


output:

res: corresponding calibrated scores obtained using the ENIR calibration model


+ enir:getMeasures(y, z);

Input:

y: vector of predictions (classification scores) which is in the interval [0, 1]

z: vector of true class of instances {0,1}

Output: 

a list of evaluation measures including (RMSE, AUC, ACC, MCE, ECE)
